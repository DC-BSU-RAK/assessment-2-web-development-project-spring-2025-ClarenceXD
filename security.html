<h3>Code of Conduct</h3>
<h4>2023/6/1 14:57:07</h4>
<pre class="textwrap">

Dear Arena Breakout Players,

We at MoreFun believe that creating a fair and respectful community is essential to providing an enjoyable gaming experience for everyone. We are excited to announce that we have now published our official Code of Conduct for all Arena Breakout players. The Code of Conduct serves as a set of guidelines that we expect all players to follow in order to maintain a positive experience for everyone.
We want to emphasize that we take the Code of Conduct very seriously and any violations will result in consequences. We have a variety of tools in place to detect and investigate any inappropriate behavior or actions that go against the Code of Conduct.
We strongly encourage all of our players to read and understand the Code of Conduct, and to adhere to these guidelines in all aspects of gameplay. We are committed to upholding these standards and will take action against any player who violates them.

-Do NOT use third-party software, including but not limited to the use of plug-ins, unofficial installation packages, illegal or unauthorized modification to client files, or any other means to disrupt the balance of the game and affect the game experience of others.
-Do NOT use third-party plug-ins or applications to enhance or alter the game in any way.
-Do NOT do any behavior that: (i) violates, or encourages any conduct that would violate any applicable law or regulation or would give rise to civil liability; (ii) is fraudulent, false, misleading or deceptive, including "trolling;" (iii) is defamatory, obscene, pornographic, vulgar or offensive; (iv) promotes discrimination, bigotry, racism, hatred, harassment or harm against any individual or group; (v) is disruptive to the Game, App, its users or user community, is violent, bullying, or threatening or promotes violence, terrorism, or actions that are threatening or disrespectful to any person or entity; or (vi) promotes illegal or harmful activities or substances.
-Do NOT misuse personal information, including but not limited to the illegal or inappropriate use of player information, such as avatars, nicknames, and personal social information that violates relevant laws and regulations, or contains pornography, violence, advertisements, etc.
-Do NOT profit illegally from gaming, such as using alt accounts to conduct malicious account activity, or renting out accounts, collecting task rewards, hoarding and selling materials, and disrupting the in-game economy.
-Do NOT engage in offline transactions, including but not limited to the buying and selling of game accounts, game currency, game props through offline or third-party websites.
-Do NOT abuse game exploits. Maliciously exploiting or spreading information related to game vulnerabilities to obtain a large amount of in-game resources, which seriously affects other people's game experience and the in-game economy, is subject to penalty.
-Do NOT engage in negative game behaviors that do not promote a positive gaming environment, including knowingly teaming up with a hacker, malicious AFKing, team killing, teaming with an enemy, smurfing or playing on an alt account, etc.
-Do NOT use unauthorized emulators to log in to the game.
-Do NOT use devices that will upset that balance of the game, such as keyboards and mouse, or macro controllers. The use of gamepads, however, is allowed.
Punishments for breaking the Code of Conduct can include but are not limited to removing chat privileges (voice and/or text), removing rankings, disabling game functions, and confiscating illegal profits. Oh, and let’s not forget: the banhammer, depending on the severity of the circumstances.

Thank you for your commitment to being a responsible and respectful member of the community. We look forward to continuing to work with you to safeguard the competitive integrity of Arena Breakout!

See you in the Dark Zone,

-The Arena Breakout Team</pre>
